## The Future of Personalized Advertising: Integrating AI-Generated Ad Copy with Deep Learning Recommendation Systems

Ad copy may be the most important feature of static digital
advertisements and yet it is neither included in most ad click-
through rate datasets nor integrated into Deep Learn-
ing Recommendation Models. Most DLRMs
are not designed to interpret textual information but are in-
stead adept at recommending content to users based on latent
patterns in copious amounts of user behavior and interac-
tion data. This limitation makes it impossible to recommend
increasingly effective ads to users on the basis of ad copy and
thus impedes the development of a system that iteratively
generates new ad copy that appeals to users unique, individ-
ual preferences. I propose a solution that adapts DLRM to
interpret textual information and integrates it with a Large
Language Model to deliver personalized ad copy to
users. This method transcends DLRMâ€™s limitations, enabling
more direct and resonant ad creation. Additionally, the pro-
posed architecture addresses the issue of repetitive ads since
new ad copy can be generated for each new ad impression.
By successfully modifying Facebook DLRM to recommend
content informed by textual data, this work validates the
viability of the proposed ad technology application.
